- Overview
- In this task you should assemble two types of reads using the De Bruijn graph representation and the Eulerian path to obtain the original sequence from that representation. 

- First type of reads : Short reads with the same size 

- Second type of reads : Pair reads with a known distance between them 

- Details
- Language : Python 

- Requirements
- Input :
Your program should be able to read a file (for the single or paired reads).
The first line would be: 
- the length of the sequences (for single reads). 
- the length of the sequences in each side and the length of the gap (for the paired reads). 
Each read will take one. 
The pair reads will be separated by “|” .. Example : AGCC|TTAA 

Output : The program then outputs the assembled sequence to the screen. (or write it in a file)

Example for single reads: 


Example for pair reads:
