# GenomicBioinformatics
### Overview
  - In this task you should assemble two types of reads using the De Bruijn graph representation and the Eulerian path to obtain the original sequence from that representation. 

  - First type of reads : Short reads with the same size 

  - Second type of reads : Pair reads with a known distance between them

### Details
  - Language : Python 

### Requirements
  - Input : program should be able to read a file (for the single or paired reads).
The first line would be: 

  - the length of the sequences (for single reads). 

  - the length of the sequences in each side and the length of the gap (for the paired reads). 

Each read will take one. 

The pair reads will be separated by “|” .. Example : AGCC|TTAA 

  - Output : The program then outputs the assembled sequence to the screen. (or write it in a file)
